 core data info:
 will have attributes:
    title
    occurence date
    [string: messages]
    string uniqueID
    String:ContactIDs - pull contact information from this list of strings, rather than save an entire contact model
 
 
 // don't have an ekevent tied to this. Just allow them to be separate, in order to allow for multiple alarms to one event without
 // conflicting, and
 
 // need to have an ek event somehow tied to this so that the day view table view can print things out easily (maybe?)
 
 // table view item view needs to have:
        - date
        - Whether there's an alarm
        - Alarm time (if applicable)
        - location info (if applicable)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    if location:
        double: latitude
        double: longitude
        double: coords(not sure why this is here if we have lat and long, but it was in the old project)
        TDI:^ look into that
        double: radius
        bool alertIfInsideArea
            ^only alerts if the user is inside the selected area, otherwise, outside
        actual address(if possible?)
        if not possible, address string
